Just an another repository

Hi! Nice to meet you, do you know my defintion of the world?

I deem the world is a circle, someone might think it is absurd because our 
world is a sphere! However, the world is a circulation in many many aspects:
people around us, changes happens everyday, even a tiny insect can make a difference.
